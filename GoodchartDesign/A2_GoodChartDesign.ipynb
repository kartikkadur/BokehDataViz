    "**Scenario:** Imagine that you manage an information technology (IT) team. Your team receives tickets, or technical issues, from employees. In the past year, you've had two team members leave and decided at the time not to replace them. You have heard a rumbling of complaints from the remaining employees about having to \"pick up the slack\". You've just been asked about your hiring needs for the coming year and are wondering if you should hire a couple more people. First, you want to understand what impact the departure of individuals over the past year has had on your team's overall productivity. You plot the monthly trend of incoming tickets and those processed over the past calender year. You see that there is some evidence your team's productivity is suffering from being short-staffed and now want to turn the quick-and-dirty visual you created into the basis for your hiring request.\n",
